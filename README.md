📘  Wind Energy Feasibility Dashboard


📌 Project Overview

This project is a Wind Energy Feasibility Dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Chart.js for visualization.
It helps users to:

Estimate potential wind energy output.

Calculate annual energy production.

Evaluate site feasibility with a score (0–10).

Visualize monthly wind variations in a line chart.
